# PortfolioPage
This is my portfolio page created with React.
Actually I had my portfolio page created with HTML first, but wanted the restructure it using React, because I wanted the have it as a single page website and improve my skills in React.
I used react router and styled components in this project.
There are some changes that I am still thinking of making.
If you have browsed my portfolio page and have suggestions, I would be happy to hear from you.(email:s_gulenc@outlook.com)
